Habitual
========

Wouldn't you love to be predisposed to act in ways that furthered goals that are
important to you? Habitual is an app that introduces users to Stanford scientist

Habits](http://www.tinyhabits.com). This app helps its users to set goals,
commit to small steps, and link those steps to their already established daily
routines.
